# Pawfect Match
A web application that matches you with dog breeds based off of a short survey.

# Functionality
This application presents a user with a 15 question survey. The user is asked questions pertaining to their lifestyle such as how active they are, do they travel, do they have family, etc. Once the user has submitted their survey, they are presented with three dog breeds that have been matched to them based off of their answers. They are shown the breed name and the attributes for that dog such as temperament, energy level, how good they are around children, etc.
